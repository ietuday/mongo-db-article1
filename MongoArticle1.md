MongoDB is an open source database that uses a document-oriented data model and a non-structured query language. It is one of the most powerful NoSQL systems and databases around today. Since it is a NoSQL database it does not use the usual rows and columns that we so much associate with the relational database management. It is an architecture that is built on collections and documents. The basic unit of data in this database consists of a set of key-value pairs.

Businesses are increasingly finding that MongoDB is ticking all the right boxes when it comes to meeting the business requirements. Here is how:
MongoDB provides the right mix of technology and data for competitive advantageIt is the most suited for mission-critical applications since it considerably reduces risksIt increasingly accelerated the time-to-value and lowers the total cost of ownershipIt builds applications that is just not possible with traditional relational databases

History of MongoDB
MongoDB saw its genesis in the middle of 2000 as part of an attempt to decipher all the NoSQL records coming thick and fast. One of its basic features is the support for dynamic schema design. It allows documents to different fields and structures. This database uses a document storage format called BSON which is a binary style of JSON style documents. It provides horizontal scalability using automatic sharding that lets data to be distributed across multiple systems in a collection.

The reason this technology came into existence was due to the scalability issues with the traditional database systems while building web applications by the founders of MongoDB. MongoDB was open-sourced in the year 2009 and is today part of the software foundation’s GNU AGPL Version 3.0 commercial license.

The needs of businesses are changing and with that the expectations of business enterprises from their databases are also changing. MongoDB has a flexible data model that works perfectly with the dynamic schema letting the developers to create applications on the fly. It offers automatic provisioning and continuous integration making it a highly productive operation. This is a far cry from the static relational schemas and complex operations that was the bane of the database systems of the past.

The data model that MongoDB follows is a highly elastic one that lets you combine and store data of multivariate types without having to compromise on the powerful indexing options, data access and validation rules. There is no downtime when you want to dynamically modify the schemas. So what it means that you can concentrate more on making your data work harder rather than spending more time on preparing the data for the database. The data scalability in MongoDB is exceptional with the option to scale your data across multiple data centers spread over geographically dispersed locations while at the same time making it increasingly easy to fetch data and scale on demand. There is no downtime and no change in access to applications while it is being scaled. Due to these reasons MongoDB is highly scalable, flexible, with high availability and recovery goals across the wide range of data centers with utmost consistency. MongoDB has an integrated set of features that lets you derive analytics and data visualization, performing in-memory processing, graph processing, text search and global replication offering a wide variety of real-time applications using just the MongoDB application. Businesses love the fact that the total cost of ownership for MongoDB is very economical. It comfortably runs on commodity hardware and thus cost can be up to ten times lesser as compared to deploying relational databases.

The architecture of MongoDB NoSQL Database
The database: In simple words it can be called as the physical container for data. Each of the databases has its own set of files on the file system with multiple databases existing on a single MongoDB server.

The Collection: A group of database documents can be called as a collection. The RDBMS equivalent of the collection is a table. The entire collection exists within a single database. There are no schemas when it comes to collections. Inside the collection the various documents can have varied fields but mostly the documents within a collection are meant for the same purpose or serving the same end goal. The Document: A set of key-value pairs can be designated as a document. Documents are associated with dynamic schemas. The benefit of having dynamic schemas is that document in a single collection does not have to have the same structure or fields. Also the common fields in a collection’s document can have varied types of data.

We can directly compare the MongoDB NoSQL with the RDBMS and map the varied terminologies in the two systems: The RDBMS table is a MongoDB collection, the column is the field, the tuple/row is the document, the table join is the embedded document. The typical schema of a relational database shows the number of tables and the relationship between the tables but MongoDB does not follow the concept of relationship.
What are the advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS?
MongoDB is not governed by schemas since a single collection can hold multiple documents and within the documents the number of fields, the size and the content of the document can greatly vary. There are no complex joins and the single object structure is quite clear. Though MongoDB cannot support the SQL language for obvious reasons, it provides a dynamic querying style on documents using a document-based query language that can be as utilitarian as SQL.  MongoDB is easy to scale and there is no need to convert or map application objects to database objects. It deploys the internal memory for providing faster access to data and storing the working set.

Why do we need the MongoDB technology?
The data storage is document-oriented style and it is done in JSON style documentsIt offers the benefit of replication and high availabilityThe data can be indexed based on any attributeIt is possible to perform auto-sharding of dataIt offers rich querying options and fast in-place updatesMongoDB is professional supported and by its growing community
Where can you use MongoDB NoSQL Database?
The MongoDB NoSQL database can be extensively used for Big Data and Hadoop applications for working with humungous amounts of NoSQL data that is the major portion of the Big Data. MongoDB can also be successfully deployed for social media and mobile applications for parsing all the streaming information which is in the unstructured format. Content management and delivery also sees extensive use for the MongoDB NoSQL database. Another domain is the user data management and working exclusively in the data hubs.

Designing schemas in MongoDB
It is important to base the schema design on the user requirements. If the objects are used together they should be combined into one document. If there is a need for separation of objects then ensure that they is no need for using joins.  Data duplication within a limit is advised because as compared to the computation time the disk space is readily available. In other words, if you feel that by duplicating data you can cut down on the processing time then go for it since commodity hardware is readily available. Data can be joined while writing but not while reading it to the disks. Schema optimization can be done for most frequent use cases. The schemas can be subject to complex aggregation.

What is the scope of this technology of MongoDB NoSQL?
Some of the biggest companies on earth are successfully deploying MongoDB with already over half of the Fortune 100 companies being a customer of this incredible NoSQL database system. It has a very vibrant ecosystem with over 100 partners and huge investor interest who are pouring money without any end.

One of the biggest insurance companies on earth MetLife is extensively using MongoDB for its customer service applications; the online classifieds search portal Craigslist is deeply involved in archiving its data using MongoDB. One of the most storied brand in the media industry the New York Times is using MongoDB for its photo submissions and the application that is deployed for form-building. Finally the extent of the MongoDB dominance can be gauged by the fact that the world’s premier scientific endeavor that is spearheaded by the CERN physics laboratory is extensively using MongoDB for its data aggregation and data discovery applications.
